# Cloud Audit — Cloud Infrastructure Security Review

Audit cloud infrastructure configurations for misconfigurations, excessive permissions, public exposure, and compliance gaps. Covers AWS, GCP, and Azure.

Cross-references: `iam-audit` for the consultant-style IAM deep-dive (design / audit / migrate across identity providers and federation patterns) — this skill includes an IAM section but stays at the cloud-posture level; for role design, JIT access, workload identity federation, and migration plans, invoke `iam-audit`. `container-audit` for Kubernetes-specific posture sitting on top of cloud. `secrets-audit` for secrets-manager hygiene and rotation.

Findings should use the three-disposition rule (Fixed / Deferred / Accepted Risk) per `owasp-audit`'s Report Format.

## Scope the Audit

Identify:
1. Cloud provider(s) and account(s)
2. Regions in use
3. Whether CLI tools are available (`aws`, `gcloud`, `az`) or reviewing IaC files (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi)

## Audit Categories

### Identity and Access Management

**AWS:**
```bash
aws iam get-account-summary
aws iam list-users
aws iam generate-credential-report && aws iam get-credential-report --output text --query Content | base64 -d
```
Check for: root account usage without MFA, access keys older than 90 days, unused credentials, wildcard permissions (`"Action": "*"`), overprivileged roles.

**GCP:**
```bash
gcloud projects get-iam-policy $PROJECT_ID
gcloud iam service-accounts list
```
Check for: primitive roles (Owner/Editor) on too many principals, unused service accounts, service account keys instead of workload identity.

**Azure:**
```bash
az role assignment list --all
az ad user list
```
Check for: excessive Owner/Contributor assignments, guest users with high privileges.

**IaC review:** Grep Terraform/CloudFormation files for `"Action": "*"`, `"Resource": "*"`, hardcoded secrets, overly broad trust policies.

### Network Security

Check for:
- Security groups or firewall rules allowing `0.0.0.0/0` ingress
- Unrestricted SSH (port 22) or RDP (port 3389) from the internet
- VPC flow logs disabled
- Databases in public subnets
- Missing network segmentation between tiers

### Storage

**AWS S3:**
```bash
aws s3api list-buckets
aws s3api get-public-access-block --bucket <name>
aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <name>
aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <name>
```
Check for: public buckets, missing encryption, no versioning, no lifecycle policies, overly permissive bucket policies.

**GCP/Azure:** Equivalent checks for Cloud Storage and Blob Storage — look for `allUsers`/`allAuthenticatedUsers` access or anonymous blob access.

### Compute

- IMDSv2 enforced? (AWS: `HttpTokens = required`)
- Unencrypted EBS volumes or disks
- Public IP addresses on instances that don't need them
- Outdated AMIs or images (check patch age)
- Privileged containers, missing security contexts in Kubernetes

### Logging and Monitoring

- CloudTrail / Cloud Audit Logs / Activity Log enabled in all regions
- Log storage: encrypted, immutable, adequate retention
- GuardDuty / Security Command Center / Defender for Cloud enabled
- Alerting configured for: root login, IAM changes, security group changes, large data transfers
- VPC Flow Logs and DNS query logs enabled

### Secrets Management

- Hardcoded secrets in source code, environment variables, or IaC files
- Secrets Manager / Key Vault usage for sensitive values
- KMS key rotation configured

## Output Format

```markdown
# Cloud Security Audit Report
## Account(s): [account ID(s)]
## Provider: [AWS/GCP/Azure]
## Regions: [audited regions]
## Date: [date]

### Summary
- Total findings: X
- Critical: X | High: X | Medium: X | Low: X

### Findings

#### [SEVERITY] [Category]: [Title]
**Resource:** [resource ARN/ID]
**Region:** [region]

**Issue:** [What the misconfiguration is]

**Risk:** [What an attacker could do]

**Evidence:** [CLI output or IaC snippet]

**Remediation:** [Specific fix command or IaC change]

---

### Prioritized Action Plan
1. [Critical — immediate]
2. [High — this week]
3. [Medium — this month]
4. [Low — next quarter]
```

## Boundaries

- Only audit accounts or projects the user has access to
- Do not attempt to access other accounts or tenants
- Provide remediation for every finding
- Note if a fix might impact availability (e.g., tightening a security group could break connectivity)
- Flag any evidence of active compromise found during the audit
- Refuse requests to exploit found misconfigurations on others' infrastructure
